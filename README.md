# TripTracker
* Simple application to help you plan a roadtrip.
* This application is still in its (early) infancy, but ideas are beginning to take shape
* This is my first Rails app, so I expect I am doing lots of things wrong, but hopefully less so as I rewrite stuff.

## Motivation
I am creating this application mainly to learn Rails (and Ruby), but I do want to make it functional. I wanted a simple web application for tracking roadtrips - create a basic itinerary, and track what happens when on that trip, day-by-day. 

## Plans

###Near-future:
* I have some upcoming model changes that will simplify the app quite a bit.  Will get rid of the pesky way_places and update Places to do more, among other things.
	* more details under doc.dependency_management.md

###Later:
* [isolate data exposure for controllers](https://github.com/voxdolo/decent_exposure)
* add Devise (not urgent)
* improve testing, use rspec.
