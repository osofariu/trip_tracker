<h1>
	Welcome to TripTracker
</h1>

<div class="weclome_desc">
	Use this application to plan and track your upcoming roadtrip. Here's how you use it:
	<ul>
		<li>Create a new trip, and give it a description</li>
		<li>Add some places to visit</li>
		<li>Make a basic skeleton of your trip by conecting places with routes, in the order in which you will visit them</li>
		<li>If you plan to make stops along the way, between two places, you can add more places to routes</li>
		<li>Once you have a skeleton of your trip you can add activities that you plan to do at each place</li>
	</ul>
