	Welcome to Trip Tracker
</h1>

<div class="welcome_desc">

	Trip Tracker allows you to plan an upcoming road trip.  Here's what you can do:
	<ul>
		<li>Add as many <em>destinations</em> as you like.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't worry about the order.  You can re-arrange your <em>destinations</em> later</li>
			<li>If you tell Trip Tracker how long you are staying at each <em>destination</em> it will help you create a draft itinerary (future)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>As you add <em>destinations</em>, Trip Tracker constructs a list of <em>routes</em> automatically based on the order in which you visit your <em>destinations</em>.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you change the order of your <em>destinations</em>, Trip Tracker will automatically recontruct your <em>routes</em>.</li>
			<li>Trip Tracker will try to compute the <em>distance</em> between <em>destinations</em>, as it creates your <em>routes</em>.  You can help it do that by providing a little more geographic information - such as "Columbus, OH" instead of just "Columbus" (future)</li>
			<li>As your routes get built-up Trip Tracker will help you decide how many miles you drive per day, so your planning is more realistic (future)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>For each <em>destination</em> you can add any number of <em>excursions</em>.  <em>Excursions</em> are useful if you use a <em>destination</em> as a hub and plan one ore more day trips from there</li>
		<li>For each <em>destination</em> or <em>excursion</em> you can create any number of <em>activities</em> to do, <em>points of interest</em> to see.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>you can estimate the cost of your trip by setting the cost of each activity.</li>
			<li>Activities are a great way to track things you want to do, such as go snorkling or a bike ride </li>
			<li>Points of interest would typically be actual places like museums or zoos. </li>
		</ul>
