# TripTracker
* Simple application to help you plan a roadtrip.

# Issues
* route validation
	* validating that you can't create new route between two points between which there's an existing route (@done)
	* validate on: update can't do the same because you may want to change something else
		* but you could change the points to new values between which there's an existing route
		* will need to check this in the code if someone modifies the end points.
